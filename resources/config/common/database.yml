# /resources/config/common/database.yml
#
# This file contains common database related settings for application.
#
# Note that these settings are used IF any environment OR local specified settings are not configured. If you want to
# override any of these values use environment specified file which is located in dev, prod or test directory. Note
# that these files are binded to application environment and are stored to VCS so those are 'common' to all devs.
#
# If you just want to override these settings in your _own_ environment you can create 'local.yml' file and override
# what ever you want to. Also note that this 'local.yml' can be created to any of following directories under config:
#   - common
#   - dev
#   - cli-dev
#   - prod
#   - cli-prod
